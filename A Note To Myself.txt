umm, yeah, let's go with this for now:
whenever you start losing your motivation and 
thinking about bullshit(you know what bullshit is better than anyone, but a hint won't hurt : one-directional dependency and attachment)
just think about these 3 people:

Alireza Kaaviani
Ali Safari
Ali Faghih Moosavi

NO WAY IN HELL FOR MY EGO TO ACCEPT THE FIRST TWO JUST BEING THAT MUCH BETTER

either gotta get proven to that they're just built different (which, i also am)
or i've just been an idiot slacking off and not giving a fuck. either way, gotta prove some points.

and the third one... with his priority being "Everyone Feeling Good And Having Fun", you're not gonna be
forgetting how he almost fucked up all of your plans and ruined the enthusiasm of you and those important to you, are you?
Fuck, i still remember the shitty feeling of that day.
this damn bastard (and every other clown participating in that circus) isn't gonna get away with what he did.
