# ICPC Training

## Welcome to Our ICPC Training Repository!
This repository marks the collaborative journey of our team preparing for the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). You'll find all the training materials and exercises we're tackling in our quest to compete at the highest level.

## Folder Structure and Contents

### Competitive Programming
In our pursuit of excellence, we've structured this folder to include resources from the *Competitive Programming* series by Steven Halim, Felix Halim, and Suhendry Effendy. It contains:
- **Books**: Digital copies of the books for reference.
  - *Competitive Programming 3*
  - *Competitive Programming 4*
- **Exercises**: Our solutions to the end-of-section problems from *Competitive Programming 4*.
- **Examples**: Our solutions to the example questions used inside the textbook to explain programming concepts and techniques from *Competitive Programming 4*.

### Our Goals
We aim to thoroughly study and learn from *Competitive Programming 4* while applying our knowledge by solving problems from the book. Our goal is to complete this challenge by summer, laying a robust foundation in a broad spectrum of topics essential for competitive programming.

### Study Approach
We are committed to a rigorous study regimen, engaging with each page and exercise. To deepen our understanding, we will complement our studies with external resources. We will include links to these resources, such as GeeksforGeeks, YouTube, CLRS, etc., for comprehensive learning and easy reference.

### Problem Solving and Coding
Upon mastering a topic, we will solve all related problems from the book. These problems, carefully curated by the authors, are invaluable for reinforcing our understanding and honing our problem-solving skills.
